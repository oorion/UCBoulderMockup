	  <h3>Understanding Our Fiscal Code of Ethics Policy</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="row-fluid">
All employees of the University of Colorado contribute to the quality of our institution, from the decisions made by the President, to every interaction each of us has with students, and everything in between.  We all work together to develop an environment of imagination, creativity and discovery.  In order to continue growing as a research institution, it is imperative that we manage our finances in a way that allows others to place their trust in us.  As a result, it is the responsibility of all employees to work together to promote fiscally responsible behavior.  To ensure that we continue to operate effectively as an organization, and that all employees understand their role, we've provided a summary below of several key fiscal responsibilities we all share.
